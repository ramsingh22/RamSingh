I am a skilled full stack developer with seven years of experience, focusing on front-end and backend development. During the years, I have also worked on several deployment projects, thus having a deeper understanding of more complex web applications. Most of my work helped me to get familiar with development operations as well. I also worked on a number of web and graphic design projects, as you can see from my previous projects.

I am getting the job done considering the necessary security aspects, as I have always been security-focused with quality analyzing skills.

Please spend a few moments of your precious time reviewing my [portfolio](http://quickeffort.com/portfolio.html).

Thank you for taking the time to get to know more about me, feel free to reach out if you feel like we could work together.
