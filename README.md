I am a skilled full stack developer with seven years of experience, focusing on front-end and backend development. During the years, I have also worked on several deployment projects, thus having a deeper understanding of more complex web applications. Most of my work helped me to get familiar with development operations as well. I also worked on a number of web and graphic design projects, as you can see from my previous projects.

I am getting the job done considering the necessary security aspects, as I have always been security-focused with quality analyzing skills.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know more about me, feel free to reach out if you feel like we could work together.
